     yarn run ios
     ```
    - Run iOS app in preview envrionment 
    
     ```bash

     ```
     - Run Android app in production environment 

     ```bash
     yarn run android:prod
     ```
    
- Note: After each change to the ```app.config.js``` file, you need to run the prebuild command for the corresponding environment.

    ```bash
     yarn prebuild:dev
    ```
    ```bash
     yarn prebuild:preview
    ```
    ```bash
     yarn prebuild:prod
    ```
- Note: Before generating a build in ```Android Studio or Xcode```, you need to load the appropriate environment using the following commands. After that, you can proceed with building from Android Studio or Xcode.
    ```bash
     yarn copy-env:dev
    ```

## How to generate build

- To generate a preview release build for your React Native project, follow these steps based on your platform:
  - For Android
    - i.e. Preview release build
    ```bash
     yarn build:android:preview
    ```
    - Note: Generates only an APK file, located at `~/PROJECT_DIR/android/app/build/`.
  - For iOS
    - i.e. Preview release build
    ```bash
     yarn build:ios:preview YOUR-TEAM-ID
    ```
    - To export the IPA, pass `true` as an argument in the build command.
    ```bash
     yarn build:ios:preview YOUR-TEAM-ID true
    ```
    - Note: The IPA and archive will be located at `~/PROJECT_DIR/ios/ios/build`.

- Note: This yarn scripts will lint your code first. If there are no lint errors, then it will run the ios or android app. Otherwise it will show the lint errors in the terminal.
